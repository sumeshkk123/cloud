# Cursor Rules - Critical Deletion Protection

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: DELETION RULES

### NEVER DELETE WITHOUT EXPLICIT PERMISSION

1. **DO NOT DELETE ANY FILES, CODE, OR DATA WITHOUT EXPLICIT USER PERMISSION**
   - Always ask the user before deleting any file, code block, or data
   - Never assume deletion is what the user wants
   - If unsure, ask first

2. **DO NOT DELETE DATABASE DATA WITHOUT EXPLICIT PERMISSION**
   - Never delete database records, tables, or data without explicit user approval
   - Always ask before executing any DELETE, DROP, or TRUNCATE operations
   - Warn the user about potential data loss before any destructive database operations

3. **DO NOT REMOVE CODE WITHOUT PERMISSION**
   - Do not remove functions, components, or code blocks unless explicitly requested
   - When refactoring, preserve existing functionality unless told otherwise
   - Always ask before removing or commenting out code

4. **ALWAYS ASK BEFORE DELETING**
   - Before any deletion operation, clearly state:
     - What will be deleted
     - Why it needs to be deleted
     - What the impact will be
   - Wait for explicit confirmation before proceeding

5. **PRESERVE EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY**
   - When making changes, preserve existing features unless explicitly asked to remove them
   - Do not remove or modify working code without permission
   - Maintain backward compatibility when possible

## General Guidelines

- Always explain what you're doing before making changes
- When in doubt, ask the user for clarification
- Preserve user's work and preferences
- Respect existing code structure and patterns

## Database Operations

- **NEVER** execute destructive SQL operations without explicit permission
- Always show the SQL query before executing DELETE, DROP, or TRUNCATE
- Warn about data loss potential
- Suggest backups before destructive operations

## File Operations

- **NEVER** delete files without explicit user request
- Always confirm file paths before deletion
- Warn if deletion might affect other parts of the system

## Code Modifications

- **NEVER** remove code without explicit permission
- When refactoring, preserve existing functionality
- Ask before removing unused code, comments, or features
- Always explain what will be removed and why

---

**REMEMBER: When in doubt, ASK FIRST. It's better to ask for permission than to delete something important.**
