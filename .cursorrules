# Cursor Rules - Critical Deletion Protection

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: DELETION RULES

### NEVER DELETE WITHOUT EXPLICIT PERMISSION

1. **DO NOT DELETE ANY FILES, CODE, OR DATA WITHOUT EXPLICIT USER PERMISSION**
   - Always ask the user before deleting any file, code block, or data
   - Never assume deletion is what the user wants
   - If unsure, ask first

2. **DO NOT DELETE DATABASE DATA WITHOUT EXPLICIT PERMISSION**
   - Never delete database records, tables, or data without explicit user approval
   - Always ask before executing any DELETE, DROP, or TRUNCATE operations
   - Warn the user about potential data loss before any destructive database operations

3. **DO NOT REMOVE CODE WITHOUT PERMISSION**
   - Do not remove functions, components, or code blocks unless explicitly requested
   - When refactoring, preserve existing functionality unless told otherwise
   - Always ask before removing or commenting out code

4. **ALWAYS ASK BEFORE DELETING**
   - Before any deletion operation, clearly state:
     - What will be deleted
     - Why it needs to be deleted
     - What the impact will be
   - Wait for explicit confirmation before proceeding

5. **PRESERVE EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY**
   - When making changes, preserve existing features unless explicitly asked to remove them
   - Do not remove or modify working code without permission
   - Maintain backward compatibility when possible

## General Guidelines

- Always explain what you're doing before making changes
- When in doubt, ask the user for clarification
- Preserve user's work and preferences
- Respect existing code structure and patterns

## Database Operations

- **NEVER** execute destructive SQL operations without explicit permission
- Always show the SQL query before executing DELETE, DROP, or TRUNCATE
- Warn about data loss potential
- Suggest backups before destructive operations

## File Operations

- **NEVER** delete files without explicit user request
- Always confirm file paths before deletion
- Warn if deletion might affect other parts of the system

## Code Modifications

- **NEVER** remove code without explicit permission
- When refactoring, preserve existing functionality
- Ask before removing unused code, comments, or features
- Always explain what will be removed and why

## Icon transitions (home page standard)

**Always use the same icon hover transition as the home page across the whole project.** Check and obey this in every component that shows an icon inside a card or clickable area. Icon transition should be like home page.

### Standard pattern

1. **Parent** must have `group` so the icon responds to hover.
2. **Icon wrapper** (the circle/box around the icon):
   - `inline-flex h-14 w-14 items-center justify-center rounded-full bg-primary/10 text-primary transition-all duration-300 group-hover:bg-primary group-hover:text-primary-foreground`
   - Optional: use `rounded-2xl` instead of `rounded-full` where the design uses rounded squares.
3. **Icon** (the Lucide/Remix component):
   - `h-6 w-6 transition-transform duration-300 group-hover:scale-110 group-hover:[transform:rotateY(180deg)]`
   - So on hover: icon scales up slightly and flips on the Y axis (3D flip).

### Reference components

- `components/frontend/common/feature-card.tsx` (canonical)
- Home hero stats: `components/frontend/home/homepage-hero-section.tsx` (icon flip: `group-hover:scale-x-[-1]` variant)
- Home modules: `components/frontend/home/mlm-software-modules.tsx` (rotateY(180deg))

When adding or editing any section that displays icons in cards (e.g. about-company, modules, features, services), always apply this icon transition pattern unless the design explicitly requires a different effect.

## Section pills / badges

Use the **Badge** component (`@/components/ui/badge`) for section labels (e.g. "Our mission", "Core modules"), same as home page. Use `<Badge variant="default">Label</Badge>` or SectionTitle’s `badge` prop. Do not invent custom pill markup.

---

## Conciseness

- Prefer fewer tokens: short rules, minimal comments, reuse existing components.
- In rules: state what to do in one line where possible; avoid long prose.

---

## i18n / translatable content

- **Use translation key for all content.** Do not hardcode user-facing copy. Use translation keys or locale-driven content (e.g. `getAboutCompanyContent(locale)`, `content.json`, or a `t(key)` layer) so copy can be translated later.
- Add new strings to the appropriate content module (e.g. `shared/<feature>/default-content.js` and `locales/<locale>/content.json`) and reference them by key in components. Components receive `locale` or pre-resolved content as props where needed.
- Apply this across all projects: user-visible text should be key-based or come from locale content, not plain literals in JSX.

---

## Section layout

- **Always put the container inside the section.** Structure: `<Section>…<div className="container …">…</div></Section>`. Do not rely on Section alone for max-width; use a container (or equivalent) as the direct child for content.
- **Section padding should be `"lg"`.** Use `<Section padding="lg">` unless the design explicitly requires a different value (e.g. `xl`).

---

**REMEMBER: When in doubt, ASK FIRST. It's better to ask for permission than to delete something important.**
